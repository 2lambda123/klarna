## Reporting a Vulnerability

Klarna and Geta take security bugs in the Klarna packages seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email responsible-disclosure@klarna.com and include the word "SECURITY - Episerver" in the subject line.

The Klarna team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
